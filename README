Locking Queue
-------------

Locking Queue is a thread-safe generic queue container based on the standard
STL std::queue. It uses some of the pieces from Boost package.

The inspiration for writing this container was Python's Queue.Queue class - 
simple, yet very powerful, especially when it comes to messaging between
threads.
